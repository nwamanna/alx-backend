Install the Babel Flask extension:

$ pip3 install flask_babel==2.0.0
Then instantiate the Babel object in your app. Store it in a module-level variable named babel.

In order to configure available languages in our app, you will create a Config class that has a LANGUAGES class attribute equal to ["en", "fr"].

Use Config to set Babelâ€™s default locale ("en") and timezone ("UTC").

Use that class as config for your Flask app.
